# ada4ros2
Main repository of the ada-ros project. Currently available for linux. A recent GNAT compiler is necessary (debian testing or Ubuntu 17.10+).

This repository is actually a ROS2 workspace. It can be checked out directly and compiled as any other ROS2 overlay:

## Instructions

1. Follow the official instructions to install ROS2. This project has been tested using the "[from source](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Linux-Development-Setup)" way.
1. Clone this repository with submodules: `$ git clone --recurse-submodules`.
1. Enter this repository root folder and issue `$ ament build`
1. Source the ./install/local_setup.bash script (or the one right for you).
1. Try to run some example nodes: `$ ros2 run rclada_examples listener`. Tab completion should work too.

Alternatively, you can import with vcs the [ada4ros2.repos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ada-ros/ada4ros2/master/ada4ros2.repos) file in this repository to prepare the Ada workspace overlay.

1. Detailed instructions to come soon.

## Creating Ada nodes

Nodes can be entirely written in Ada, without the need for any C/C++ files or main program.
Please check the examples in the [rclada_examples](https://github.com/ada-ros/rclada_examples) repository for some ideas.

Ada code is compiled using gprbuild. This project provides some CMake functions to greatly simplify
the inclusion of a GPR project in the ROS2 build process:

- Your ROS2 package should use the **cmake** build method of ament/colcon.
- See the next section and the package `rclada_examples` to see the available CMake functions.

### cmake build type

To simplify the integration of GPR-based Ada projects, the rclada package provides the following CMake functions:

- `add_ada_executable(TARGET GPRFILE OUTFILE)`
    - TARGET is the executable being built
    - GPRFILE is the *.gpr file that provides that executable
    - OUTFILE is the subfolder+name in which the TARGET is built. It __must__ be different from the plain TARGET.

### colcon_ada build type

Not yet implemented.

[colcon](http://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) is still being deployed into ROS2, and the ada4ros2 project is awaiting for the first ROS2 source version that includes it in its official documentation (see pull request [#168](https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/168)).

## Using the ROS Client Library binding (rclada).

The library is provided by the rclada package, on which your own package has to depend.

The GPR project file is named `rcl.gpr`, that you have to `with` on your own project file.

There are two hierarchies of Ada packages in the Ada RCL binding:

1. `RCL.*` packages form the high-level, manually curated binding. It is currently being completed.
1. `RCLx.*` is the automatically generated binding (with `g++ -fdump-ada-spec`). It is not intended for direct use but it should be complete if something is still missing in the high-level binding.

Additionally, there is both a high-level and low-level binding to `rosidl` packages:

1. `ROSIDL.*` packages are used by `RCL.*`, and by users to deal with messages/services.
1. The low level bindings to `rosidl_generator_c`, `rosidl_typesupport_c`, and `rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c` 
are too autogenerated, and should not be needed unless you use something from `RCLx.*`, which should not be the case.

### Implementation status

#### RCL client library:

These statuses refer to the high-level binding; the low-level one is always generated.

- Main features:
    - `RCL.Node`: Complete ![green](https://placehold.it/8/00aa00/000000?text=+)
    - `RCL.Publisher`: Complete ![green](https://placehold.it/8/00aa00/000000?text=+)

    - `RCL.Client`: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)
    - `RCL.Service`: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)    
- Support:
    - `RCL.Allocators`: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)
    - `RCL.Executors`: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)
    - `RCL.Graph`: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)

    - `RCL.Wait`: Complete ![green](https://placehold.it/8/00aa00/000000?text=+)

Note that some features of the C RCL that are natively supported by Ada (e.g., concurrency and real-time) are low-priority and may remain unported if no clear need arises.

  - Exportable libraries: Pending ![red](https://placehold.it/8/ff0000/000000?text=+)

## Extras

Some developer notes I have taken:
- Fixed size arrays are generated in place in the message struct (metadata size=fixed size)
- Variable size arrays are generated as a member message with pointer and size (metadata size=0)

Since rclada initially attempted to follow the ros2_java project structure, I did these dependency graphs on the java_examples package.
This one is simplified removing some common and indirect dependencies, you can see the full one [here](doc/java_example_depends.png).
These might help in understanding some of the interrelations amongst ROS2 packages.
