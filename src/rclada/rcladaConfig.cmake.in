# - Config file for the rclada package
# It defines the following variables
#  rclada_INCLUDE_DIR  - include directory with GPR file

set(rclada_INCLUDE_DIR "@rclada_INCLUDE_DIR@")
set(rclada_SUPPORT_DIR "@rclada_SUPPORT_DIR@")

# MACROS FOR ADA PROJECTS
include(@PROJECT_BINARY_DIR@/rclada_project.cmake)

## No idea what this means:
# Our library dependencies (contains definitions for IMPORTED targets)
# include("${rclada_DIR}/export_rclada.cmake")

# These are IMPORTED targets created by rcladaTargets.cmake
